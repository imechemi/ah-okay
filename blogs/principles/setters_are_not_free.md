# Free setters comes responsibility

We tend to create even more setters for objects now using Lombok. They make mundane tasks easier, also makes us generate codes that we don't need. "Just use @Setters on class" is 
the last thing I want to hear. Why I am saying that is that? it now allows for state change via multiple interfaces, and nobody is taking responsibility for maintaining 
system consistency.
